# ðŸš¦ Road Sign Detection with YOLOv8

A computer vision project that uses the Ultralytics YOLOv8 architecture to detect and classify road signs in images and real-time video streams. This repository contains preprocessing, model inference, and evaluation steps to demonstrate accurate and efficient road sign detection.

ðŸŽ¯ **Project Overview**

**Objective:** Leverage YOLOv8 to accurately locate and classify various road sign categories (e.g., stop signs, speed limits) in images and live video.

**Approach:** Use a pretrained YOLOv8 model fine-tuned on a road sign dataset. Perform inference through a notebook or the provided script, and visualize detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
